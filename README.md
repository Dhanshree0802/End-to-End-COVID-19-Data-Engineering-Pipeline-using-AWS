# End-to-End COVID-19 Data Engineering Pipeline using AWS

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a cloud-based data engineering pipeline for analyzing COVID-19 datasets. By leveraging AWS services, it enables efficient storage, ETL processing, and data analysis, culminating in insightful visualizations using business intelligence tools.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Overview
This pipeline utilizes various AWS services and external BI tools:

### 🟩 1. Amazon S3
- Acts as the data lake source.
- Stores raw COVID-19 datasets.

### 🧬 2. AWS Glue Crawler
- Scans data stored in S3 and automatically infers schema.
- Creates metadata tables in AWS Glue Data Catalog to make the data queryable.

### 🔍 3. Amazon Athena
- Performs serverless SQL queries directly on S3 data.
- Useful for initial data exploration and validation.

### 🧪 4. AWS Glue ETL Jobs
- Cleans, transforms, and enriches raw data.
- Converts raw data into a structured, analytics-friendly format.
- Writes the transformed data into Amazon Redshift for scalable storage and processing.

### 🟪 5. Amazon Redshift (within VPC)
- A scalable data warehouse for storing structured COVID-19 datasets.
- Optimized for complex analytical queries.

### 📊 6. Business Intelligence (BI) Tools
- Connected directly to Redshift for reporting and visualization.
- Tools Used:
  - **Tableau**
  - **Power BI**
  - **Google Data Studio (Looker Studio)**
- Enables the creation of dashboards and reports to uncover trends, patterns, and risk factors.

## 📁 Dataset
COVID-19 dataset is available at: **[Google Drive Link](#)** *(Ensure access is granted before using)*.

## 🔄 Data Engineering Pipeline Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**: COVID-19 dataset is uploaded to **Amazon S3**.
2. **Schema Detection**: **AWS Glue Crawler** scans the raw data and infers the schema.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: **Amazon Athena** is used to perform SQL queries directly on S3.
4. **ETL Processing**: **AWS Glue ETL Jobs** transform and clean the raw data.
5. **Data Warehousing**: Transformed data is stored in **Amazon Redshift** for optimized querying.
6. **Business Intelligence & Visualization**:
   - BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Looker Studio connect to Redshift.
   - Dashboards and reports are created for insights.

## 💡 Why This Project is Important
- Showcases how to build a **real-world, scalable data pipeline**.
- Combines **serverless computing, ETL processing, data warehousing, and analytics**.
- **Public health insights**: Helps in tracking trends, analyzing patterns, and identifying risk factors in COVID-19 data.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **AWS Account** with access to S3, Glue, Athena, Redshift, and IAM permissions.
- **BI Tools** (Tableau, Power BI, or Looker Studio) installed.
- **Python & Boto3** (if automating the ETL process).

### Deployment Steps
1. **Upload dataset** to **Amazon S3**.
2. **Create a Glue Crawler** and execute it to infer schema.
3. **Run Athena queries** to explore data.
4. **Set up AWS Glue ETL job** to clean and transform data.
5. **Load transformed data** into **Amazon Redshift**.
6. **Connect BI tools** to Redshift and create dashboards.

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
- Automating pipeline execution using **AWS Step Functions**.
- Implementing **AWS Lambda triggers** for event-driven processing.
- Enhancing data security using **AWS IAM policies and encryption**.
